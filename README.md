Here is a project that I did in November 2021 on advertisement expenditures. 

Dataset information: The name of the dataset is called "Advertising expenditures, by medium: 1867-1998"
                     The link to the dataset is http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ISBN-9780511132971.De482-537 

File information: 
    - advertisements.ipynb: is Jupyter Notebook that contains the code to the visualizations that were created
    - advertising-expenditures-powerpoint.pdf: is a pdf file of a powerpoint presentation that contains visualizations with descriptive captions 
    - advertising-expenditures-document.pdf: is a pdf file of a document that contains a 1.5-page, written, historical account on the different technologies that revolutionized the world without looking too much in depth at the visualizations and code
